## Dev Tools

### Pre-commit
Automate code linting with pre-commit.

1. Install pre-commit (if not already)
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

2. Install the hooks into your Git repo:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

3. Run it manually before commit (optional):

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
